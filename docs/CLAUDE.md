# CLAUDE.md - EPA608PracticeTest.net Master Guide

> ⚠️ **REALITY CHECK (updated 2026-05-29) — read before trusting the rest of this file.**
> Parts of this guide describe an earlier, content-only vision and are now out of date.
> Actual current architecture:
> - **Two layers.** A static SEO site in `public/` (the `.html` pages + `test-engine.js`,
>   runtime question data = `public/questions.json` + `public/questions-flagged.json` only),
>   AND a full **Next.js 15 SaaS app** in `src/` (Supabase auth, tiers, AI tutor, dashboard,
>   certificates, teams, offline mode).
> - **Not "free forever / no signup."** The app has required auth and **paid tiers**
>   (free + Pro). Payment is **PayPal only** (`src/app/api/paypal/**`,
>   static `public/checkout.html`). Paddle and LemonSqueezy were removed.
> - The "13 live pages" list below is stale — there are ~40 static pages plus the app routes.
> - Draft/legacy question JSON lives in `_archive/question-bank/`, not `public/`.
>
> The content strategy / SEO / writing guidance below is still useful. The status,
> page counts, and "monetization: free SaaS" lines are historical.
