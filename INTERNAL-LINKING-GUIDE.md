# INTERNAL LINKING GUIDE

## Core Principles

### 1. One Link Per URL Per Article (Maximum)
- Each unique URL can only be linked **ONCE** per article
- Example: If you link to `/universal.html` in paragraph 2, do NOT link to it again anywhere else in that article
- This prevents over-optimization and distributes link equity better

### 2. Contextual Homepage Links
- Link to homepage (`/`) only when it creates a **contextual bridge**
- Good: "Learn more about our free EPA 608 practice tests on our [homepage](/)"
- Bad: Random homepage link in footer or navigation text
- Homepage links should feel natural and provide value to the reader

### 3. Quality Over Quantity
- Aim for 3-5 internal links per article (not counting breadcrumbs)
- Every link must add value and context
- Links should flow naturally within the content

---

## Link Priority Matrix

### For Every Article, Link To (in priority order):

#### Priority 1: Primary Tool CTA (Required)
- Every article MUST link to at least ONE practice test tool
- Choose the most relevant tool for the article topic
- Place in main content area, not just CTA section

**Tool Selection Guide:**
- Study guide articles → Most relevant Type tool
- Certification articles → `/universal.html` (most comprehensive)
- Exam prep articles → Tool matching article focus
- Type-specific articles → Matching Type tool

#### Priority 2: Related Article in Same Section (Recommended)
- Link to 1-2 closely related articles in the same section
- Must be highly relevant to current topic
- Creates topical authority clusters

#### Priority 3: Cross-Section Article (Optional)
- Link to 1 article from a different section if highly relevant
- Creates site-wide content connectivity
- Example: Study guide linking to certification guide

#### Priority 4: Homepage (When Contextually Relevant)
- Only if it creates a natural bridge
- Typically when mentioning "our practice tests" or "our resources"
- Should enhance user experience, not just SEO

## Tool Pages (Practice Tests)

### `/universal.html`, `/core.html`, `/type-1.html`, `/type-2.html`, `/type-3.html`

**Links to:**
- `/` - Homepage (return to home)
- Relevant study guide (1 link max, e.g., universal tool → `/study-guides/universal.html`)
- NO other internal links (keep users focused on taking test)

---

## Link Placement Best Practices

### 1. In-Content Links (Priority)
- Place links naturally within paragraphs
- Use descriptive anchor text matching target page keyword
- Link early in content when possible (first 300 words ideal)

**Good Anchor Text Examples:**
- "Take our [EPA 608 universal practice test](/universal.html)"
- "Read our complete [EPA 608 study guide](/study-guides/study-guide.html)"
- "Learn about [EPA 608 certification requirements](/certification-guide/certification.html)"

**Bad Anchor Text:**
- "Click here"
- "Read more"
- "This link"

### 2. CTA Sections
- Can include 1-2 prominent tool links in CTA boxes
- Use button styling for primary CTA
- These count toward your 1-link-per-URL limit

### 3. Related Resources Section
- Place at end of article
- List 2-4 related articles
- Use descriptive link text
- These count toward your 1-link-per-URL limit

### 4. Breadcrumb Links
- Do NOT count toward link limit
- Always include: Home → Hub → Article
- Use structured data markup

---

## Anchor Text Strategy

### For Tool Pages:
- "EPA 608 [type] practice test"
- "Free [type] practice exam"
- "[Type] practice questions"

### For Study Guides:
- "EPA 608 [topic] study guide"
- "[Topic] study guide"
- "Complete EPA 608 study guide"

### For Certification Pages:
- "EPA 608 certification [variant]"
- "[Variant] certification guide"
- "How to get EPA 608 certified"

### For Homepage:
- "EPA 608 practice tests" (when listing all tools)
- "Free practice exams" (when mentioning free resources)
- "Our homepage" (generic but contextual)

---
