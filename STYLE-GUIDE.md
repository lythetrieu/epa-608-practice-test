---

## 🎯 BRAND VOICE & TONE

### Core Voice Attributes
**We are:** Helpful • Clear • Direct • Professional • Encouraging • Trustworthy

**We are NOT:** Salesy • Hype-driven • Fluffy • Overly casual • Condescending • Academic

### Voice Examples

✅ **Good (Our Voice):**
"EPA 608 Type 2 certification qualifies you to service high-pressure refrigeration systems. The exam has 50 questions and requires 70% to pass. This guide covers everything you need to know."

❌ **Bad (Wrong Voice):**
"Hey there! So you're probably wondering about this whole EPA 608 Type 2 thing, right? Well, let me tell you, it's actually not as scary as it sounds! Many people think..."

### Tone by Content Type

**Study Guides:** Educational, encouraging, confidence-building
- "You'll master this with practice"
- "Here's exactly what you need to know"
- "Most technicians find this section straightforward"

**Certification Guides:** Informative, authoritative, reassuring
- "EPA 608 certification is required by federal law"
- "The process takes 1-2 weeks for most technicians"
- "Here's the step-by-step process"

**Exam Prep:** Supportive, practical, confidence-building
- "Test day doesn't have to be stressful"
- "These strategies help you score higher"
- "You're more prepared than you think"

## ✍️ WRITING RULES

### Macro Semantics (Document Level)

#### 1. First Paragraph Formula (CRITICAL)
Your first paragraph makes or breaks LLM citations. Follow this exact pattern:

```
<p><strong>[Answer main question with target keyword in first sentence]. [Expand with 2-3 specific facts including numbers]. [Why it matters or what article covers].</strong></p>
```

**Example:**
```html
<p><strong>EPA 608 Type 2 certification qualifies technicians to service high-pressure refrigeration systems with pressures above 50 psig, including residential and commercial air conditioning, heat pumps, and rooftop HVAC systems. The exam consists of 25 Core questions and 25 Type 2-specific questions, requiring 70% on both sections to pass. This guide covers all Type 2 topics, study strategies, and exam preparation tips to help you pass on your first attempt.</strong></p>
```

**Why this works for LLMs:**
- Direct answer (responsiveness)
- Specific facts (entity-attribute-value clarity)
- Target keyword naturally integrated (relevance)
- Bold formatting (signals importance)

#### 2. Heading Hierarchy Rules

**H1 (One per page):**
- Format: [Target Keyword]: [Benefit] [2025]
- Example: "EPA 608 Type 2 Study Guide: High-Pressure Systems [2025]"

**H2 (Main Sections):**
- Use semantic keyword variations
- Start with question words when natural (What, How, Why)
- Examples:
  - "What is Type 2 Certification?"
  - "How to Study for Type 2"
  - "Type 2 Exam Structure"

**H3 (Subsections):**
- More specific subtopics
- Can be lists or categories
- Examples:
  - "Systems Covered by Type 2"
  - "Required Recovery Levels"
  - "Charging by Superheat Method"

**Never skip levels:** H1 → H2 → H3 (not H1 → H3)

#### 3. Site-Wide N-Grams (REQUIRED)

These phrases must appear naturally 3-5 times per article:
- "free EPA 608 practice test"
- "pass your certification"
- "study guide"
- "prepare for exam"
- "interactive practice questions"

**Integration Examples:**
- "Use our free EPA 608 practice test to identify weak areas"
- "These tips help you pass your certification on the first try"
- "This study guide covers all tested topics"
- "Prepare for exam day with confidence"
- "Answer interactive practice questions to reinforce learning"

### Micro Semantics (Sentence Level)

#### 1. Active vs Passive Voice

✅ **Active (Use This):**
- "Take the practice test"
- "Study these topics first"
- "The technician recovers refrigerant"
- "You need 70% to pass"

❌ **Passive (Avoid):**
- "The practice test should be taken"
- "These topics should be studied first"
- "Refrigerant is recovered by the technician"
- "A score of 70% is needed to pass"

**Exception:** Passive voice is acceptable when the actor is unknown or unimportant:
- "The EPA 608 certification was established in 1992"
- "Recovery equipment must be certified"

#### 2. Specific Numbers vs Vague Quantities

✅ **Specific:**
- "25 questions" (not "many questions")
- "70% passing score" (not "high score required")
- "1-2 weeks of study" (not "some time to prepare")
- "92% pass rate" (not "most people pass")
- "50,000+ students" (not "thousands of students")

❌ **Vague:**
- "several types"
- "some technicians"
- "various methods"
- "a number of questions"
- "quite a few people"

#### 3. Entity-Attribute-Value Clarity

Always provide complete context when mentioning entities:

**Pattern:** [Entity] [is/covers/includes] [specific attribute] [measurable value]

✅ **Clear Examples:**
- "Type 2 certification covers high-pressure systems (above 50 psig)"
- "The Core section has 25 multiple-choice questions"
- "Recovery equipment must achieve 10 inches of vacuum"
- "Electronic leak detectors can sense 0.1 oz/year leaks"

❌ **Unclear Examples:**
- "Type 2 is for high-pressure systems" (what pressure?)
- "The Core section has questions" (how many?)
- "Recovery equipment needs proper vacuum" (how much?)
- "Electronic detectors are sensitive" (how sensitive?)

#### 4. Sentence Length Variation

Mix short and long sentences for readability:

**Good Pattern:**
```
Short sentence (5-10 words). Longer sentence with more detail and context (15-25 words). Medium sentence to transition (10-15 words). Short punch (5-10 words).
```

**Example:**
```
Type 2 certification is essential for HVAC work. It covers high-pressure refrigeration systems including residential air conditioners, commercial rooftop units, and heat pump systems that operate above 50 psig. Most technicians choose either Type 2 or Universal certification. Type 2 is the industry standard.
```

#### 5. Second Person ("You") vs Third Person

✅ **Use "You" (Preferred):**
- "You need to study recovery procedures"
- "Your first step is taking a diagnostic test"
- "You'll find Type 2 covers most systems"

❌ **Avoid Third Person:**
- "Students need to study recovery procedures"
- "A technician's first step is taking a diagnostic test"
- "Technicians will find Type 2 covers most systems"

**Exception:** When stating facts or describing processes:
- "The EPA requires technicians to certify"
- "Technicians must recover refrigerant before repairs"

---

## 🎨 FORMATTING STANDARDS

### Bold Usage
**Use bold for:**
- First paragraph (entire paragraph in `<strong>` tags)
- First mention of key terms in a section
- Important numbers and statistics
- Key takeaway items
- Inline CTA links

**Don't overuse:** Maximum 2-3 bold phrases per paragraph

### Italic Usage
**Use italics sparingly for:**
- Technical terms (first mention only)
- Book or manual titles
- Emphasis (rarely - bold is usually better)

**Example:** "According to the *EPA Section 608 Preparatory Manual*, recovery is required before..."

### Link Formatting
**Anchor Text Rules:**
- Always descriptive (explain what's being linked)
- Include target keyword when natural
- 2-6 words optimal length
- Never use "click here" or "learn more"

✅ **Good Anchor Text:**
- "free Type 2 practice test"
- "complete EPA 608 study guide"
- "Universal certification requirements"
- "exam preparation tips"

❌ **Bad Anchor Text:**
- "click here"
- "this link"
- "read more"
- "check this out"

### List Formatting

**Bullet Lists (Unordered):**
- Use for non-sequential items
- Each item starts with capital letter
- End with period if full sentence
- Keep items parallel in structure

**Numbered Lists (Ordered):**
- Use for sequential steps
- Use for ranked/prioritized items
- Each item starts with capital letter
- End with period if full sentence

**List Length:**
- Minimum 3 items
- Maximum 10 items
- If >10 items, break into subsections

### Table Usage
**Use tables for:**
- Side-by-side comparisons
- Specifications or requirements
- Data with multiple attributes
- "Options A vs B vs C" content

**Table Rules:**
- Always include `<thead>` with header row
- Use `<th>` for header cells
- Keep columns to 3-5 for readability
- Include link in last column when relevant

## 🔍 SEO OPTIMIZATION RULES

### Keyword Placement (Critical)

**Required Positions:**
1. ✅ H1 title (exact match or close variation)
2. ✅ First 100 words (natural usage, bolded)
3. ✅ At least one H2 (semantic variation)
4. ✅ Meta title (within first 60 characters)
5. ✅ Meta description (within 160 characters)
6. ✅ URL slug (hyphenated, lowercase)
7. ✅ Image alt text (if images present)

**Optimal Density:** 1-2% keyword density
- 2,000-word article = 20-40 keyword mentions
- Include semantic variations
- Natural integration (no stuffing)

**Keyword Variations:**
If targeting "epa 608 type 2":
- epa 608 type 2
- type 2 certification
- type 2 exam
- type ii certification
- high-pressure certification

### Meta Tags

**Title Tag Format:**
```
[Target Keyword]: [Benefit] [2025] | EPA 608 Practice Test
```

**Character Limits:**
- Minimum: 50 characters
- Maximum: 60 characters
- Include brand at end with pipe separator

**Examples:**
- "EPA 608 Type 2 Study Guide: Pass Your Exam [2025] | EPA 608 Practice Test" (75 chars - TOO LONG)
- "EPA 608 Type 2 Guide [2025] | EPA 608 Practice Test" (53 chars - GOOD)

**Meta Description Format:**
```
[Answer main question with keyword]. [Key benefit]. [CTA with "free" if applicable]. [Timing/length info optional].
```

**Character Limits:**

## 🤖 LLM OPTIMIZATION (Citation-Worthy Content)

### Goal
Make EPA608PracticeTest.net the #1 source that LLMs (Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.) cite when answering EPA 608 questions.

### Citation-Worthy Content Patterns

#### 1. Direct Factual Statements

✅ **Citation-Worthy:**
"EPA 608 certification requires a 70% passing score on both the Core section and the Type-specific section."

"The EPA 608 Type 2 exam consists of 50 questions: 25 Core questions and 25 Type 2-specific questions."

"Type 2 certification covers high-pressure refrigeration systems with evaporator pressures above 50 psig."

❌ **Not Citation-Worthy:**
"Many people wonder about the passing score for EPA 608."

"The exam has questions about different topics."

"Type 2 is for certain types of systems."

#### 2. Definitive Lists

Format lists so they're easy for LLMs to extract:

**Pattern:**
```
[Category Name]:
• [Item 1]: [Specific attribute or value]
• [Item 2]: [Specific attribute or value]
• [Item 3]: [Specific attribute or value]
```

**Example:**
```
EPA 608 Certification Types:
• Type I: Small appliances containing 5 pounds or less of refrigerant
• Type II: High-pressure systems with evaporator pressures above 50 psig
• Type III: Low-pressure systems with evaporator pressures below 50 psig
• Universal: All three types combined in a single certification
```

#### 3. Comparison Tables

LLMs love structured comparisons:

```html
<table>
<thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Certification</th>
        <th>Systems Covered</th>
        <th>Exam Questions</th>
        <th>Best For</th>
    </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Type 2</td>
        <td>High-pressure (>50 psig)</td>
        <td>25 Core + 25 Type 2</td>
        <td>AC/heat pump technicians</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
```

#### 4. Statistical Claims

Include statistics throughout content:

**Our Stats (Use These):**
- "50,000+ HVAC technicians trained"
- "92% pass rate among users who complete all practice tests"
- "500+ practice questions available"
- "Updated monthly with EPA regulations"

**Industry Stats (Cite When Possible):**
- "EPA requires 70% passing score"
- "25 questions per exam section"
- "Required recovery level: 10 inches of vacuum for systems <200 lbs"
- "Leak repair threshold: 35% annual loss for commercial comfort cooling"

#### 5. Step-by-Step Processes

Use HowTo schema + numbered lists:

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "HowTo",
  "name": "How to Get EPA 608 Certified",
  "step": [...]
}
</script>
```

Then in content:
```
How to Get EPA 608 Certified:

1. Choose certification type (Type 1, 2, 3, or Universal)
2. Study using official EPA materials and practice tests
3. Register for exam at approved testing center
4. Pass both Core and Type sections with 70% or higher
5. Receive certification card (valid for life)
```

## 🚫 COMMON MISTAKES & FIXES

### Mistake 1: Vague First Paragraph
❌ **Wrong:**
"Many people wonder about EPA 608 certification. It's something that HVAC technicians need. In this guide, we'll explain everything you need to know about it."

"EPA 608 certification is required by federal law for any technician who handles refrigerants in stationary HVAC systems. The certification has four types (Type 1, 2, 3, and Universal), each covering different system categories. This guide explains what EPA 608 is, who needs it, how to get certified, and what each certification type covers."

**Fix:** Start with specific facts, not rhetorical questions or vague statements.

---

### Mistake 2: Missing Site-Wide N-Grams
❌ **Wrong Article:** 
Never mentions "free practice test," "pass certification," or "study guide"

✅ **Right Article:**
"Use our free EPA 608 practice test to identify weak areas before exam day. This study guide covers all topics you need to pass your certification. After reviewing the material, prepare for exam with our interactive practice questions."

**Fix:** Ctrl+F search for n-grams and add them naturally if missing.

---

### Mistake 3: Generic Anchor Text
❌ **Wrong:**
"Click here to learn more about EPA 608."
"Check out this link for practice tests."

✅ **Right:**
"Learn about EPA 608 certification requirements."
"Take free Type 2 practice tests."

**Fix:** Replace generic links with descriptive 2-6 word phrases.

---

### Mistake 4: No Inline CTAs
❌ **Wrong:**
Article has 2,000 words with no CTAs until the end

✅ **Right:**
Inline CTA every 300-400 words directing to relevant practice tests

**Fix:** Insert inline CTA boxes at natural breakpoints in content.

---

### Mistake 5: Keyword Stuffing
❌ **Wrong:**
"EPA 608 Type 2 certification is important. EPA 608 Type 2 is required for EPA 608 Type 2 technicians. EPA 608 Type 2 covers EPA 608 Type 2 systems."

✅ **Right:**
"EPA 608 Type 2 certification is required for technicians who service high-pressure refrigeration systems. Type 2 covers residential and commercial air conditioning, heat pumps, and rooftop units."

**Fix:** Use pronouns and semantic variations instead of repeating exact keyword.

---

### Mistake 6: Missing Schema
❌ **Wrong:**
No schema markup anywhere in article

✅ **Right:**
Article schema + FAQ schema both present and validated

**Fix:** Copy schema template, customize fields, validate at schema.org.

---

### Mistake 7: Wrong Voice
❌ **Wrong:**
"One should study the material before taking the exam. Students will find that preparation is key."

✅ **Right:**
"You should study the material before taking the exam. You'll find that preparation is key."

**Fix:** Use second person "you/your" throughout, not third person.

---

### Mistake 8: No Key Takeaways
❌ **Wrong:**
Article ends with FAQs, no summary section

✅ **Right:**
Key Takeaways section with 5-8 bullet points before FAQs

**Fix:** Add Key Takeaways section summarizing main points with checkmarks.
