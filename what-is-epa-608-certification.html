            <h1>What is EPA 608 Certification?</h1>
            <p>Your complete roadmap to earning the mandatory federal technician license for HVAC professionals.</p>
        </section>

        <p>If you intend to work on air conditioning and refrigeration systems in the United States, obtaining an <strong>EPA Section 608 Technician Certification</strong> is not optional—it is a federal requirement. Mandated by the Clean
            Air Act, this certification ensures that technicians know how to safely handle and recover refrigerants that
            can deplete the ozone layer or contribute to global warming.</p>

            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>The Four Types of Certification</h2>
        <p>The EPA 608 exam is divided into four technical sections. To earn a certification, you must first pass the
            <strong>Core Section</strong>, and then any of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Type I:</strong> For servicing small appliances (5 lbs or less of refrigerant).</li>
            <li><strong>Type II:</strong> For servicing high-pressure systems (residential AC, split systems, heat
                pumps).</li>
            <li><strong>Type III:</strong> For servicing low-pressure systems (centrifugal chillers).</li>
            <li><strong>Universal:</strong> Awarded if you pass all four sections (Core, I, II, and III).</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout">
            <h3>Why Is This Mandatory?</h3>
            <p>Under the <strong>Clean Air Act</strong> (Section 608), the EPA mandates certification for any technician who handles refrigerants. Refrigerants like CFCs and HCFCs contain chlorine, which destroys the Earth's stratospheric ozone layer.
                Even newer HFCs (like R-410A) are potent greenhouse gases. The Section 608 program ensures only trained
                professionals can buy or vent these chemicals.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>How to Get Certified (Step-by-Step)</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Choose Your Path:</strong> Decide if you need Type I, II, III, or the Universal certification
                based on your job role.</li>
            <li><strong>Study the Materials:</strong> Focus on leak rates, recovery standards, and safety procedures.
                (Use our <a href="/study-guides.html">Free Study Guides</a>).</li>
            <li><strong>Practice the Exam:</strong> Take multiple mock tests to ensure you hit at least 80%
                consistently.</li>
            <li><strong>Schedule the Proctor:</strong> Find an EPA-approved testing center or an online proctored
                service.</li>
            <li><strong>Pass and Receive Card:</strong> Most providers issue a physical wallet card and a digital
                certificate.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Passing Score and Difficulty</h2>
        <p>To pass any section, you must score at least <strong>72%</strong>. On the typical 25-question battery, that means you can
            only miss 7 questions. The Core section is often considered the most difficult because it involves legal
            statutes and chemistry facts that aren't used in daily field work.</p>


        <h2>Which Certification Do You Need? (Scenario Guide)</h2>
        <p>The right certification depends on the systems you service daily. Use this guide to identify your path:</p>
        <table class="data-table" style="margin:20px 0;">
            <thead><tr><th>Your Work Environment</th><th>Certification Needed</th><th>Practice Test</th></tr></thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr><td>Domestic fridges, window ACs, vending machines</td><td>Core + Type I</td><td><a href="/type-1.html">Type I Test →</a></td></tr>
                <tr><td>Residential central AC, heat pumps, split systems</td><td>Core + Type II</td><td><a href="/type-2.html">Type II Test →</a></td></tr>
                <tr><td>Commercial chillers, large HVAC plants</td><td>Core + Type III</td><td><a href="/type-3.html">Type III Test →</a></td></tr>
                <tr><td>Mixed environments, commercial contracts</td><td>Universal (all four)</td><td><a href="/universal.html">Universal Test →</a></td></tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>2026 Updates: The AIM Act and HFC Phase-Down</h2>
        <p>The American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act of 2020 now directly affects EPA 608 certification content. Current exams include questions on the phased reduction of HFCs — particularly R-410A — and the transition to lower-GWP A2L refrigerants such as R-32 and R-454B. Technicians must understand flammable refrigerant safety classifications (A2L = mildly flammable) and updated handling requirements. Our <a href="/study-guides.html">2026 study guides</a> are updated to reflect these changes.</p>

        <h2>Certification vs. License — What's the Difference?</h2>
        <p>EPA 608 certification is a federal credential issued by EPA-approved organizations. It is <em>not</em> a state license. Many states require additional contractor licenses to operate a business, but the EPA 608 certification itself is nationally recognized and has no expiration date — for a full breakdown of validity rules and what happens if you lose your card, see our <a href="/certification-validity-and-expiration-rules.html" style="color:#007acc;font-weight:600;">EPA 608 certification validity and expiration rules guide</a>. A certified technician can legally purchase refrigerant from any EPA-registered distributor in any state.</p>
        <p>Note that EPA 608 and EPA 609 are two separate federal certifications covering different refrigerant systems. If you work on mobile air conditioning (vehicles), you may also need an <a href="/difference-between-epa-608-and-609.html" style="color:#007acc;font-weight:600;">EPA 609 certification — see the full EPA 608 vs 609 comparison</a> to understand which applies to your work.</p>
